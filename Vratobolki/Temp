This is a temporary email account of a IOI 2017 contestant. If this is not the current IOI (International Olympiad in Informatics) president Greg Lee's email, please disregard this email.

I want to report on some irregularities surrounding IOI 2017. I believe that these irregularities will happen during IOI 2018 as well.

In the interest of unambiguity, the irregularities consist of cheating between leaders and contestants of a certain IOI delegation. The contestants acquired information surrounding the tasks from one of the delegates (leader, deputy leader).

Can I get Your confirmation that what's in this email and the following emails will be confidential i.e. no mention to any of the mentioned persons, any member of the IC, IOI 2017 delegates, or IOI 2017 contestants? If so, I will provide my full testimonial on the surrounding events.

Thanks for your time,
a IOI 2017 contestant
